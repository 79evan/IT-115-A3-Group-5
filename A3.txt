green little apples you ate today.

B is for baby

See the baby!
The baby is fat.
The baby is pink.
The baby can cry.
The baby can laugh.

See the baby play!
Play,Baby,Play.
Mommy loves the baby
More than she loves you.

Z is for zoo

Let's go to the zoo.
See all the animals!
The nimals are locked inside the cages.
Poor animals!
Who will let them out???

See the elephnt in the zoo.
Give the nice elephant some peanut shell with pepper inside.
That will be a good joke on him.
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
The elephant is mad but don't worry-
by tomorrow the elephant will have forgotten all about it.

------------------------

See the nice tiger in the zoo
The tiger is peeking out of the grass at you and---
Say--
There is no grass in the zoo
Where are the iron cages?
There are no cages.
Hey, this is no zoo
This is the jungle..
And all those wild animals are loose
And you'd better run FAST!
